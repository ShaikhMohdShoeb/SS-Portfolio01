Create a modern, techie-themed portfolio for Shoeb Shaikh, a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with 5+ years of IT experience specializing in Azure Infrastructure and Azure DevOps. The portfolio should be professional, engaging, and optimized for developers. It should include the following sections:

About – A detailed professional summary highlighting his expertise in Azure and DevOps.

Skills – A section showcasing his technical skills, including Azure services, DevOps tools, automation, CI/CD, and scripting.

Experience – A timeline of Shoeb’s work experience, including roles, responsibilities, and achievements.

Projects – A showcase of key projects related to Azure Infrastructure & DevOps, including technologies used.

Certifications – A section listing relevant Azure and DevOps certifications.

Contact – An interactive section with email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.

The portfolio should have a futuristic, developer-centric UI with a tech-inspired design. Consider using modern frameworks like Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap. The site should be responsive, fast-loading, and SEO-optimized. Include an option to host it on GitHub Pages or Vercel."

I'll implement smooth page transition animations for a better user experience. I'll use Framer Motion for this since it's already installed and provides great animation capabilities.

"Update my portfolio homepage to improve its structure and alignment for a more professional look. Implement the following changes:

Remove the redundant "About Me" section from the homepage since the hero section already introduces me.

Enhance the hero section:

Keep my name and title as they are but slightly increase the font size for better emphasis.

Add a one-line summary below my title that briefly states my expertise (e.g., "I specialize in Azure Infrastructure & DevOps, helping businesses streamline cloud operations.").

Ensure the CTA buttons ("See My Experience" & "Get in Touch") are well-aligned and visually distinct.

Improve the "Skills & Expertise" section:
Arrange skills into a grid layout instead of a single column for better readability.

Add icons next to each skill for a professional touch.

Maintain consistent spacing between skill categories.

Ensure mobile responsiveness:
Adjust text sizes and layouts to look clean on smaller screens.

Add smooth scrolling between sections for better navigation.

Maintain a clean and modern UI:
Use consistent padding, margins, and font styles.

Keep color contrast optimized for readability.

Apply these refinements while keeping the overall theme and branding intact.
